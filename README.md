in this assignmemnt i implemented 3 interfaces that used for building and exploring  a graph data structure.
there are 7 files in this folder:
1. weighted_graph: an interface that represents an undirectional weighted graph.
2. WGraph_algo: a class that implementes weighted_graph_algorithms. 
3. weighted_graph_algorithms: an interface that represents some Graph Theory algorithms.
4. WGraph_DS: a class that implementes weighted_graph.
5. node_info: an interface that represents the set of operations applicable on node (vertex) in an undirectional weighted graph.
6. WGraph_algoTest2: a Junit test file that tests WGraph_algo methods.
7. WGraph_DSTest2: a Junit test file that tests WGraph_DS methods.
